# What is this?

This is some experimental idea to build web apps. It's inspired by HTMX, SvelteKit Form Actions and use:enhance.

- Gets idea of HTML as app state from HTMX.
- Also, uses the idea of form actions from SvelteKit to have a site both works with JS and without JS.

It's just an experiment, not a project or anything. I'm just trying to see if it's possible to build a web app with this idea. Proof of concept or something.

If works might make a proper project out of it.

This doesn't replace [cherry-ts](https://github.com/DeepDoge/cherry-ts). If it works, it will be a different thing. And both can be used together.

## Vision

Ok, so since there are no written down vision, I'll write it down here.
I'm gonna put some rules on what this should be.

- So we wanna have something that uses HTML as the app state. I think concept can is named "Resumability" by Qwik. But unlike Qwik, we don't use JSON to store the state. We use HTML. So it's more like HTMX.
- We want every action on the page to work without JS by default. And if JS is enabled, we want to enhance the experience. So this idea is inspired by SvelteKit's form actions and `use:enhance` directive. We should use `<form>`(s) and `<a>`(s) for actions. So when there is no JS, the browser can handle the action. And if there is JS, we can enhance the experience. To make working with `<forms>`(s) easier developers can use `form` attribute.
- So we don't wanna add things like event listeners to an element by finding element with `querySelectorAll`, or MutationObserver to observe some attributes.
  This approach is used widely by some projects, but it requires you to handle ShadowDOM too for example, and we don't know what future might bring.
  So we are gonna use the native way to handle this. We are gonna use custom elements (without ShadowDOM) with `is` attribute. For example we can do `<form is="enhanced-form">` and this will make the element enhanced/interactive using JS. This is equivalent to `<enhanced-form>`. So this is just native JS and HTML. We use `is` attribute to keep the semantics.

## Duck Typing

Alright so I started to see the idea of "Snippets" here. They are reactive parts of the page with a source. How they work atm is pretty much faulty. Just trying to figure out what is a "Snippet" and how it should work. It can be the only thing that is needed to make this work. I'm not sure yet.

What is snippet? snippet is a custom element with a `display: contents` style. It has a `src` attribute and it fetches the src and replaces it with its contents. It's like an iframe but it's just a part of the page. A snippet only fetches its content when it also has an `load` attribute, after loading, it removes the attribute. On SSR we can send it with the content and not add the `load` attribute. So it will not fetch the content again on the client. But if client wanna refresh the content, it can do it. So this is different than HTMX approach. HTMX can only update the fetched part of the page. But this can fetch the content again at multiple places.

So how do we decide when to refresh a snippet? well most of the time `<form>` itself will update the content of snippets itself. Because result of form action can be an HTML. There should be a `Map<string, SnippetElement[]>` so we can find Snippets with their src without `querySelectorAll`. So our job is deciding which snippets should update and how. Hmm maybe instead of having a map by `src`, we can make the map based on when they snippet update. For example /cart/count should update when ?/addCart action runs. But actions are not associted with paths so how, some how we should update every snippet that stars with `/cart/` or equal to `/cart` well `<form>` can be inside a snippet with a src of `/cart/add-button/abc-123itemId`.

But this still doesn't tell where to update, should it update `/cart/add-button` or `/cart` or `/`? Alright for now im just gonna have an attribute on the `<form>` element until i can find a better solution, this attribute will tell which snippets to update like update="/cart" so it will update every snippet that starts with `/cart` or equal to `/cart`. I think since with JS we get full page load anyway, all of our solution should be based on telling where to update specifically when there is JS. So snippets put themselves into a map when they are connected to the DOM. so `/cart/count` should put itself at `/cart/count` and `/cart` on the map. So map is just a listeners map for snippets. Tbh we don't even have to use a Map, we can emit events on the window, like `update:/cart` this makes more sense.

So same thing with routing? I believe I should first figure out routing before actions, it seems more complex. We should have a snippet for every route or something like that, we should or more like we should have a snippet for every slot. So let's say we have a path like this, with each page inside their parent with slots, `/a/b/c`. So HTML should be like this:

```html
Root
<snippet-x src="/">
	<!-- This is the slot -->
	<snippet-x src="/a">
		A
		<snippet-x src="/a/">
			<!-- This is the slot -->
			<snippet-x src="/a/b">
				B
				<snippet-x src="/a/b/">
					<!-- This is the slot -->
					<snippet-x src="/a/b/c"> C </snippet-x>
				</snippet-x>
			</snippet-x>
		</snippet-x>
	</snippet-x>
</snippet-x>
```

So snippet for slot should always be there even if the slot is empty. That way we know where to place the inner page. Since HTML is the state we have to specify where the slot is.
So if we are at '/', html should be like this:

```html
Root <snippet-x src="/"></snippet-x>
```

Then we go to `/a/b`:

```html
Root
<snippet-x src="/">
	<!-- This is the slot -->
	<snippet-x src="/a">
		A
		<snippet-x src="/a/">
			<!-- This is the slot -->
			<snippet-x src="/a/b"> B </snippet-x>
		</snippet-x>
	</snippet-x>
</snippet-x>
```

Ok this doesn't make sense because if we tell `src="/a"` to update it will remove B. or it will have 2 Root text if we tell `src="/"` to update. I think we can just use `<slot>`.
Or umm, updating the snippet src on page change somehow can be better. But this pratically would have a single snippet- for all routes. Which would cause everything to update.
Ok snippets are not made for routing. we need `<slot>` maybe. or `<slot-x>`.

With slots `/a/b/c` should be like this:

```html
Root
<slot-x src="/">
	A
	<slot-x src="/a/">
		B
		<slot-x src="/a/b/"> C </slot-x>
	</slot-x>
</slot-x>
```

if we goto `/` it should be like this:

```html
Root <slot-x src="/"></slot-x>
```

So we find the slot '/' and placed the new content at its parent.

then we go to `/a/b`:

```html
Root
<slot-x src="/">
	A
	<slot-x src="/a/"> B </slot-x>
</slot-x>
```

So we search for the slot `/a/` doesn't exist, so we search for `/` and place the content at its parent.

then we go to `/a/b/c`:

```html
Root
<slot-x src="/">
	A
	<slot-x src="/a/">
		B
		<slot-x src="/a/b/"> C </slot-x>
	</slot-x>
</slot-x>
```

So we search for the slot `/a/b/`, it doesn't exist, so we search for `/a/` ...
Ok so something weird, i think we should first find the slot then fetch. because if we go from `/` to `/a/b/c`, we need a, b and c.
And currently server would only give c, so we either have to tell server give me between these routes. Or fetch them one by one.
Gonna look more into HTMX boost, brb...

We don't want so many seperated logic on server side, server side should be simple, include layout or not include layout thats it.
Server side shouldn't think about more. So we should fetch them one by one.

Or not HTMX adds an header saying the current-url so based current url and requested url, server can decide what to send.
So we can just send the current url.

HTMX changes are based on element `id` we don't wanna abuse global id space. So that's why we do everything based on path. So we can have multiple snippets with same path. Or `<form>` can say, my result should also update snippets that listens changes on this path.

This way everything is more url related.
A snippet is saying to client that, "so if you wanna update this part of the html, you can get an updated version from this url/src".

Ok, also we said `<form>` can have an `data-update="/cart"` or similar attribute telling it which snippets should be updated after this form action. So `/cart` can mean only update the `/cart` and `/cart/` can mean update `/cart` and its child paths. I mean since snippets listen for events, they can listen their parent paths with `/` suffix.

But working routing is the first thing to do. So we have slots as shown above. And we should send the current url to server, so it can decide which parts to send. As you can see we use slots with paths. no random element with random id.

We make sure everything works without JS, not to make site work on older browsers, thats a side effect. We make sure site also works without JS, so it's using correct html elements for correct jobs. I was thinking seperating slots from snippets, can be problematic. Now we both have to update snippets and the slots based on form action. hmm. Maybe i can make snippets work in a way that they work like slots.
Ok so a slot path ends with `/`, so if a snippet src endsWith `/` it acts like `<slot>` perhaphs? yeah makes sense maybe... So if we try to update snippet with a src ending with `/` maybe it can only update its child snippets or not update at all. idk.

Writing snippet is kinda hard, so im just gonna call it snip. maybe i call the whole library snip and framework snip-kit.

All we have is a new element called `snip`. (and enhanced, version of `a` and `form`)

Alright so new goal.

Both `a` and `form` does the same job. snippets use shadowdom, to show content so its isolated.
when an enhanced `form` or `a` submitted or clicked, and if there is js, we find the closest root of the element and if its a snip,
we get the `src` from it, resolve it into a full url, and use that url to do the thing.

So if the host changed, we let the browser handle it. if pathname changed, it causes a route change.
And if pathname didn't change, we just update the snips(s) that listens to the path. that simple.

We can also have a `data-update` attribute on `form` and `a` and we use it instead of the `src` of the root snip.
If root isn't a snip, nothing happens.

That's another rule if we can't decide what do update we don't update anything. So developer doesn't go "wtf, why this thing updated?".

I think this is an epic way.

So only thing left to decide how to work is routing and i have a few ideas about it rn.

In sveltekit and many other frameworks, its either server side code is seperated or code both runs on server and client. But we don't want that. We want a server side code and a client side, we dont want full hydration, we dont wanna override what the server sends on hydration.
So since server sends the html the code that generates the html runs on server. only way to run client side code is.
importing into html with `<script>` probably, and using custom elements.

- So HTML is app state, by default
- Every action works without JS, by default
- If JS is enabled, we enhance the experience
- We respect the semantics of HTML, and native js features
- We use paths to build a hierarchy of snippets, so we can update them easily, we don't use ids like HTMX
- And if you want client side code, you can import it with `<script>` and use custom elements

I think without going further, with this is main point having snips and enhanced forms and links.
I think having a simple library that does this is enough. We shouldnt go further than this.

Then i can make a framework that uses this library. I think this is a good idea.

But I also wanna improve cherry-ts with the things i learned from this.
which is kinda hard because cherry-ts design to be a SPA library. And it relays on heap mostly.

I think the plan is im gonna treat this and cherry-ts as different projects.

but i wanna go from this to a something that work without a server.

i wanna build it first as something that requires a server, then i wanna make it work without a server.

then maybe i can focus on this instead of cherry-ts.

cherry-ts gonna get updates still, i wanna make it into my previous vision.
and build eternis with it.

once i build eternis with it, that means that its a working library.

then i can make docs for it.

and then go further with this. and maybe make something better than cherry-ts.

then use it to remake eternis.

i think this is a good plan.
